# Wearables E-Commerce Project

Hi, This is one of my Concordia Diploma in Full-Stack Web Development Projects. Here is the demo video link:  https://youtu.be/Zve7cyztygI

Description: As an e-commerce website, customer can see all the items in specific categories, chose items, adjust checkout cart and checkout. The checkout process is very closed with the reality at point that many people may chose a same product which will belong to the customer who checkout first (incase product is still available). The customer who put that product in shopping cart will receive a message if this person can not buy it.

Technologies: React.js, CSS, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Node-RESTful APIs
